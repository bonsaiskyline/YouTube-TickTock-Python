      "Well, Jasmine Enberg is a principal analyst at social media in Insider Intelligence. And I put it to her that since there's no evidence that TikTok has passed data on to the Chinese government, how does the chief executive go about proving a negative? It was incredibly tough questioning, and there was very, very little that Chu could say to sway U.S. lawmakers' minds. He really had to prove a negative, that TikTok isn't or can't be used by the Chinese Communist Party to influence U.S. public opinion. In that sense, it's not just about data privacy. It's about soft influence and the type of content that is served on TikTok. How important is TikTok to American consumers and American businesses? It's becoming incredibly important. There is a lot of creators who have built their brands and built their businesses on tick tock and who would be severely impacted if the app were to be banned here. That said a lot of creators are prepared for the potential of a ban. They're already using other platforms. Many of them have set up small businesses so they do have other ways of reaching their customers and their audiences. Can TikTok actually do without an American market if it needed to? Is that a possibility or not at all? Well the US is an incredibly important market for tick tock and billions of dollars are at stake here. So at Insider Intelligence we estimate that tick tock will rake in about seven billion dollars in the US alone. And that's about half of its worldwide ad revenues. Now a lot of tick tocks meteoric growth over the past couple of years has also come at the expense of some US based companies including Meta and YouTube. So it's incredibly important. And there's a lot of factors at play here for for why this is happening. And what did we actually learn from the committee hearing yesterday? Did we learn any more about the access that the Chinese government might have to data or not really? There weren't really any big revelations today. Chu stuck mainly to his talking points. He talked a lot about Project Texas and the work that they're doing to protect and store American data on U.S. soil, but he didn't really offer much new evidence or much new in terms of what they're doing. That said, he also didn't always have a lot of time to be able to answer a lot of the questions that the lawmakers proposed. Again, it was really incredibly tough questioning, and he stuck mainly to those talking points.\n",
      "cnn-10\n",
      "And that's a skepticism in the sense that there have been engineers who have admitted that they've been able to get access to U.S. data in China. And the concern is, even if there's no public evidence now of anything nefarious, that if China wanted to do it, whether it's to interfere in a U.S. election, whether to promote its views that we can take Taiwan, that the Chinese, maybe they're not doing it today, but they have the opportunity, the technical ability, and then the power of coercion, the communist regime to say, sorry. And lawmakers on both sides of the aisle were concerned about that and asking questions about whether or not, even if the data was fully based in Texas, whether the Chinese government would be able to compel employees of ByteDance to be able to provide that data. Ultimately, though, even if Congress passes this legislation, it will fall at Joe Biden's feet. It will be up to the president to determine whether or not, of course, to sign the legislation. But if one of the versions that Congress passes gives the authority to the president of the United States to ban TikTok, if he chooses to do so, Biden would then have to decide whether he wants to ban it. You talked about some of the political concerns here. The White House has brushed aside political concerns. But when you have two thirds of young Americans saying that they don't want to see TikTok banned, and then you also have, within President Joe Biden's approval rating, young people essentially dragging down his approval rating among Democrats, it's hard to see how political considerations wouldn't at least be on their minds, regardless of what the decision he makes is. That's a fascinating question as you go into 2024 in the sense that the Republicans say Chinese Communist Party just about every other breath. Right. And they believe it's and look it's a very important issue. It's a very important geopolitical issue whether we're talking about social media or we're talking about the South China Sea whether we're talking about the war in Ukraine. China comes up all the time. But the growth of the company that does make the politics interesting. In 2020 about 100 million users the CEO repeatedly reminding people today it's up to 150 million now. And you look at this Quinnipiac poll. Do you support a tick tock ban. Forty nine percent of Americans say yes. Forty two percent. No. So a slight plurality close to a majority. But you see the split there. But then look at the age differences. Older Americans say sure. And again they're more open to the idea of it. Younger Americans say no. So how complicated is this. We talk about Congress for a president who might get the authority to get to ban or could use other administrative steps to do something. But.\n",
      "cnn-12\n",
      "Yeah, well, there's also a broader conversation, too. I was talking to some senators yesterday. Of course, there's a national security component, but also there's the mental health component, especially for young people. And Senator Chris Murphy, for example, he told me that he has a teenage son, and he wants the conversation around TikTok to be much broader than just China and national security. And so he almost thinks that Congress is too singularly focused on China on this issue. So we'll see where this goes next. But that gets you into the broader conversation with other social media companies as well, where they talk a lot and they use them as a piñata a lot, but they have been unable to reach a consensus about what to actually try to pass.\n",
      "cnn-5\n",
      "with me in studio to share their reporting and their insights. Leanne Caldwell of The Washington Post CNN's Melanie Zanona Francesca Chambers of USA Today and Sarah Fisher of Axios. The CEO is doing his best to say we will protect this data. We have this new project underway to get it out of Singapore get it out of Asia. We'll be all in America. They don't believe it. So the question is what will Congress do. The scorn is bipartisan. But there's a lot of scorn for Facebook and Instagram and Twitter and American social media companies and they can't agree on what to do. Will they agree here. I think they're in a lot of agreement here. There seems to be bipartisan support for taking action on TikTok. The question's actually not what Congress will do, it's what will the courts do? So the White House and CFIUS, the Committee for Foreign Investment in the United States, may say that TikTok has to be banned if it's not sold to a US company. But like Donald Trump tried to do this in 2020, the courts will ultimately have to support that decision. That's where the next step of this comes to fruition. And then the last question, of course, is who even would buy TikTok? This is a very expensive company. You know, in 2020, when it had 50 million fewer users, it was valued at roughly 30 billion, according to some reports. Now imagine, who can even afford to buy something like that and get it passed through regulatory scrutiny? So there's a lot of questions, John, about how we get to this hearing to the next step. And so the members of Congress are saying we will pass legislation allowing us to ban you from the United States unless you have a sale, a bite dance, a Chinese health company sell it publicly. The CEO keeps trying to say we hear you, we will fix it. Listen here, here's the idea being that look, we understand you think the Chinese government can access this data, we're going to create a firewall, it won't happen.\n",
      "cnn-7\n",
      "Yeah, there's a lot of politics here, too. This was a bipartisan grilling of the CEO of TikTok. So they are in agreement, members of Congress, Republicans and Democrats, on that. But this also comes with some political consequences also. Are members of Congress willing to ban TikTok, understanding that there are a lot of young users who use it, potential voters? There's been a higher percentage of young people who voted in the last election than in the last several decades. And this impacts Democrats more than it impacts Republicans. Republicans are a lot less worried about the political blowback than Democrats are. For example, the Senate Republican Campaign Committee, they actually have a policy that their candidates, that they do not use TikTok to campaign. Meanwhile, Democrats have been utilizing this app on the campaign trail. And so a ban might be too much for some Democrats. Yeah.\n",
      "cnn-8\n",
      "And I would point out, leadership in the House has actually not yet committed to bringing a ban forward. They said there's a number of different proposals. They're working their way through the committee process. I'd also point out, there are some lobbyists who are closely aligned to Kevin McCarthy, a former California Republican, who's lobbying on behalf of TikTok, a former McCarthy aide. So it is a question of what McCarthy's going to do, but this hearing was just a disaster for TikTok. You had lawmakers coming out in the middle of it, renewing their calls, or coming out for a ban on TikTok, if it shows you how well it went for TikTok. It's hard to imagine that there won't be some sort of congressional action. Yeah, and it's interesting. You mentioned what will the administration do, what will the courts do. Congress has the ball at the moment. And the chairwoman, Cathy McMorris-Rogers, just scornful from the beginning, just full of distrust. And again, they want definitive answers. They want yes or no. Listen here as she presses for answers, and she says, I'm not getting them on the question of can you actually keep the Chinese? Can you say no to Xi Jinping, essentially?\n",
      "dw_news-4\n",
      "Moving US user data to the US is part of Project Texas, a plan that TikTok says will keep the data out of China's reach. But lawmakers seem unconvinced by the show's reassurances. If it does get banned, 150 million users in the US would lose access to the short video app. Winning over the US government is proving harder than getting more Americans on TikTok. Well, I'm joined now by Lindsay Gorman. She is head of technology and the geopolitics team at the nonprofit organization, the Alliance for Securing Democracy. And she joins me from Washington, D.C. It's good to have you with us tonight. Let's just talk about what we saw happen in that room today. The CEO of TikTok, he was grilled hard and heavy. The impression I got was that he read the room completely wrong and that this was a PR disaster for him. How did you see it?\n",
      "dw_news-5\n",
      "I think that's exactly right. I think we saw him receive one of the frostiest receptions from US Congress that we have seen in years. And this was a committee that was extraordinarily well-prepared to ask the hard-hitting questions, both about TikTok's Chinese ownership, and that included very detailed questions about financial ties, Shou Chu's own compensation, and whether that comes from TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, the compensation of employees, his own relationship with ByteDance employees and members of the Chinese Communist Party. So really detailed questions on TikTok's Chinese ties, and also really detailed questions on the technology itself. You know, we heard lawmakers talk about bytecode and about neural network architectures and artificial intelligence, and that's pretty unprecedented for the US Congress, which five years ago, when they were grilling Mark Zuckerberg, had absolutely no clue what they were talking about. Bye.\n",
      "dw_news-6\n",
      "Yeah, I mean, it really was an about face. It's like the roles were reversed today when you when you compare it to how it was when Zuckerberg was sitting there and talking to members of Congress. We know that lawmakers now are not happy with social media platforms in general. But TikTok, it's special because it also happens to be Chinese owned. The Chinese Communist Party has access. It could have access to 150 million U.S. hearts and minds. That's what the lawmakers said. Talk to me about this danger that members of Congress were talking about today. I think that's a great way of putting it. And there are really two real dangers that members of Congress have seized upon. The first centers around sort of the more narrow threat of data privacy and data security. The idea that all social media platforms, including TikTok in particular, collect massive amounts of data to build these user profiles. And TikTok in particular, the genius of the app's algorithm is that it can really understand what you wanna watch, what you like, what you dislike. And that can translate into a voter profile and a profile for influence. So the data piece of it is of high concern and that's what this Project Texas was designed to alleviate. But then the other concern, the second concern, which is almost a bigger one, is that the social media platforms and the algorithms that they use are constantly making decisions second by second, minute by minute on what content we see and when and why. And the idea that the Chinese Communist Party could influence that and up-regulate content that they want Americans to see and down-regulate content such as on Taiwan or on Chinese activists that they don't want Americans to see, that's where the real national security issues come in that make TikTok distinct from the social media platforms that we're used to that are based in democratic countries. Lawmakers today, they took TikTok to task for not doing what it promises when it comes to content moderation. I want you to take a listen to what Congresswoman Kat Kamig from Florida said after she shared a threat that was posted on TikTok against the committee chairwoman. And that threat, by the way, that is still posted on TikTok today. Take a listen.\n",
      "dw_news-8\n",
      "Yeah, certainly Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, all these platforms are sorely in need of stronger oversight when either involving the data that the congressman was talking about or content moderation. And this has been sort of a thorn in Washington's side for the better part of the last five years. And we've really seen very little movement so far on this broader tech platform regulation. But I think there's a real chance now that the platform in question has this extra threat of being based in China and ultimately potentially beholden to the Chinese Communist Party. I think we're now able to see these broader tech regulation ideas such as content moderation, such as data privacy in a new light that may make lawmakers more willing to consider some of these guardrails against the massive loopholes that we have in our technology ecosystem. I think you would agree with me that lawmakers are kind of late to the to the party here when it comes to holding social media responsible and accountable particularly for Misinformation on their platforms. I mean They're correct when they say this is dangerous perhaps On tik-tok because it's coming from a foreign Power, but what about Facebook? What about the last US election for example and the 2016 election? We know that Facebook was used by Russia US intelligence has told us that they used Facebook to try to manipulate the election Where was the fury from Congress over that? You're absolutely right. These issues of foreign influence and foreign interference in US democracy and elections are not new. But I think there was fury over Facebook's role in the 2016 election, including from lawmakers. Maybe not as uniform as we saw today, but this has been something that lawmakers have been hammering on about social media platforms for years now. And I think the question is, why haven't we seen more action beyond just words? Because this is clearly something that needs to be addressed. But I think one thing in the United States, we have this section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which provides a very strong liability shield, particularly on content for these social media platforms. And actually, the same committee that grilled the TikTok CEO today is currently looking into precisely that provision and asking questions about whether we need to reform that act and make any changes to that liability shield. It's something the Supreme Court took up recently. So I think the conversation is certainly not done on content moderation and section 230 when it comes to the broader tech regulation. Yeah. And, Lisbeth, let me ask you about that before we run out of time. These two things, what do you see happening? Do you think that TikTok will be banned in the United States? And do you think TikTok is the company that is going to push Congress to change this Section 230 and, you know, hold these platforms responsible, make them liable for the content that's on their platforms? I do. I do think that this is finally the nail in the coffin when it comes to social media platforms before real regulation becomes part of our legal code. And the reason it's been clear today is that even the Republican chair of the committee today called for federal privacy legislation, something that's been a fact of life in Europe for years now and the United States has flagged on. You know. Yeah, it's true. I heard him say that and it struck me too. That's what the Europeans have been calling for for years. We have that here. And now you have these U.S. lawmakers who are on board and perhaps it took a Chinese company to bring them there. Lindsay Gorman, head of technology. Yeah, exactly. Head of technology and the geopolitics team at the nonprofit organization, the Alliance for Securing Democracy. We appreciate your time and your insights tonight. Thank you. Thanks for having me.\n",

      "back, gentleman from Texas. Chair recognizes for five minutes, Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you, Mr. Chu, for bringing Republicans and Democrats together. Appreciate that. I wanna get right to the critical point of concern. So TikTok is able to collect massive amounts of personal data, we all know that. That means it could, if it desired, to use this data to influence narratives and trends, create misinformation campaigns, encourage self-destructive behavior, purposefully allow drug cartels to communicate freely and organize human and drug trafficking. And to be fair, all social media companies could do that. But here's the difference. It is only TikTok that is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party. All these other social media companies are not. Mr. Chu, do you agree that TikTok is controlled by the CCP? No. Okay, I thought you'd say that. I disagree, as you thought I might say. Here's why I disagree. Your parent company is ByteDance, right? That's correct. It is correct. So many of the workers who work at ByteDance, they're Communist Party members, right? I wouldn't know. I wouldn't know. Well, I think, for example, the chief editor at ByteDance, Zhang Vuping, is the Communist Party secretary, correct? He works under Chinese business, not on TikTok. Right. He works for ByteDance. The parent company. He works on the Chinese business. Right. The parent company of TikTok. He works on the Chinese business. The Chinese business is called Douyin. Yeah, but it's all associated with bite dance, right? So by dance owns a number of businesses right there you are Right, you all report to ByteDance. Everybody's part of ByteDance, okay? And do you know of any other employees that work for ByteDance that are part of the Chinese Communist Party? Like I said, you know, they are, Bidense has owns Chinese businesses and they operate in China. know how many, but you acknowledge many must be card-carrying members of the CCP, right? In the Chinese business, yes. I mean the CCP holds a what's called a golden share invite dance that allows the CCP to control one board seat invite dance That's public. It's not correct. It's not correct. It's been publicly reported. They admitted to it That's not correct. It's not correct? It's been publicly reported. They admitted to it. You can, on our website, we have updated it so we can give people more transparent information on this. They have a share in a subsidiary that is only for the Chinese business. It has nothing to do with TikTok. And it's for the purposes of content licensing in China. So there's not an internal CCP committee, which is a regular thing that happens in China. They have a CCP committee internally inside the company. I run TikTok. I cannot represent this business. Talking about ByteDance. No arrangement in ByteDance? Here's the main point of concern. China's 2017 national intelligence law states very clearly that, quote, any organization or citizen shall support, assist and cooperate with state intelligence work in accordance with the law and maintain the secrecy of all knowledge of state intelligence work. In other words, ByteDance and also your TikTok employees that live in China, they must cooperate with Chinese intelligence whenever they are called upon. And if they are called upon, they're bound to secrecy. That would include you. So Mr. Chu, if the CCP tells ByteDance to turn over all data that TikTok has collected inside the U.S., even within Project Texas, do they have to do so according to Chinese law? So here's. Congressman, first, I'm Singaporean. That's fine, but there are employees of yours and by dances in China China. We understand this concern. In my opening statement, we said we hear these concerns. We didn't try to avoid them or trivialize them. We built something where we take that data and put it out of reach. This is what we did. We put it out of reach. Out of reach, but they own you. No, we put it out of reach by storing them. ByteDance owns TikTok. If ByteDance is told, and the CCP owns ByteDance because the CCP owns everybody in China. So by law, they can make them do whatever they want. And they say that by law, you can't tell anyone about it. So they can make you hand over that data. Is that correct? And so my That data is stored here, in American soil, by an American company, overseen by American Well, you say that, we've thought that, but leaked audio from 80 internal TikTok meetings shows that US user data has been repeatedly accessed from China when you said it hasn't been. And here's the other thing, following back on my colleague's line of questioning, in your own privacy policy, it says that you may even share information within your so-called corporate group. Is ByteDance part of that corporate group? If you're talking about the share of the entity with the share, like I shared with the previous Is ByteDance part of the corporate group? ByteDance as a holding company is part of the corporate group, yes. Okay. So your own privacy policy says you have to share data with ByteDance. And if the CCP says, hey, ByteDance, you're going to do what we say, and you can't tell anyone about it, because by law, according to that 2017 national intelligence law, they have to do it. That's our concern. Maybe you haven't done it yet, but my point is that you might have to. And that's where our concerns come from. I mean, over 300 TikTok employees have worked for China's state‑run propaganda media. That's just from looking at their LinkedIn profiles. Okay. So my last point is this. I want to say this to all the teenagers out there and TikTok influencers who think we're just old and out of touch and don't know what we're talking about, trying to take away your favorite app. You may not care that your data is being accessed now, but it will be one day when you do care about it. And here's the real problem. With data comes power. They can choose what you see and how you see it. They can make you believe things that are not true. They can encourage you to engage in behavior that will destroy your life. Even if it is not happening yet, it could in the future. The long‑term goal of the Chinese Communist Party is the demise of the American power, and that starts with our youth. At any moment, they could demand that all of TikTok's data be used to design an AI algorithm with the sole purpose of promoting Chinese interests and destroying our society from within. You want to know why Democrats and Republicans have come together on this? That's why we are so concerned. Thank you, and I yield back. Maybe you haven't done it yet.\n",

Sort of how he endorsed a bill that would increase reimbursement rates for pharmacies when he owned three pharmacies. But apparently he couldn't increase the resolution on this video because it's stuck in 360p. Anyways, let's get right into it. We may not always agree on how to get there, but we care about our national security. You apparently don't care about getting the name of the person you're speaking to, right? Thank you Madam Chair. Mr. Crew, welcome to the most bipartisan committee in Congress. Who the fuck is Mr. Crew? Well, maybe this guy can go a full minute without mentioning communism. And you know, research has shown that TikTok is the most addictive platform out there. And the Chinese Communist Party knows this. Uh, nope. 50 seconds, so close. because two-thirds of all the youth in our country are on your app. Two-thirds? This guy seems more like a fan of three-fifths if you catch my drift. If you look behind me, Mr. Cruz, you see some of the challenges that we've seen on TikTok. You know about them. You know about the milk crate. You know about the blackout challenge. You know about the NyQuil chicken challenge. The NyQuil Chicken Challenge? So many of these challenges began as actual jokes and memes, and I know internet post-humor is hard to grasp for some, but no child with more than five brain cells is taking any of these seriously. And if you are actually trying NyQuil chicken, you deserve everything that's coming to you. I want to ask you, as I understand it, there's a sister app in China, Duikin. I'm sorry if I'm butchering the pronunciation. Do they have these same things over there? Representative Carter asks whether these kinds of challenges are popular on Douyin, TikTok's Chinese sister app, because he seems to believe that they aren't and that indicates that TikTok is pushing harmful things exclusively in America. I have no doubt that there are similar phenomena across cultures because that's just how humor works. But also, in my opinion, if Douyin and China really don't have any of these challenges, that's more of a tell on us rather than them, because maybe they're just not stupid enough to do all this kind of stuff.

The chief of the social media app, Shozy Chu, was grilled by lawmakers over a whole range of issues, mostly related to the company's Chinese ownership. His appearance before the Congressional Committee comes after the Biden administration threatened to ban the social media app if the company's Chinese owners didn't sell their shares. TikTok is wildly popular in the States. It's got over 150 million American users, including almost 5 million businesses. Well, our North America business correspondent, Michelle Flurry, has been following the story from Washington, D.C. It was never going to be easy, but from the moment the committee chairman opened the hearing calling for TikTok to be banned in the United States, there was no let up. TikTok CEO, Shoji Chu, was bombarded by lawmakers, worried that the app's Chinese ownership makes it untrustworthy and that it is harmful to American teenagers. Politicians of all stripes slammed TikTok, including Republican representative, Buddy Hsu.\n",

So now he's got to figure out, even if they do force TikTok to sell to a US company, can they get China on board to let them sell? That's going to be a huge political negotiation that he has to manage on top of all the other national security conversations he's having with China.

      "What percentage of TikTok's source code is the same as Dolan? What percentage? I can get back to you on the specifics. Okay, I'd appreciate that. Where was the source code for TikTok developed? Was it developed in China or in the United States? It's a global collaborative effort. Was it developed in China? Some of it? Some of it is. Okay, at ByteDance. When it's compiled in the compilation process, can bytecode be manipulated? We've talked a lot about source code. What about the bytecode, the ones and zeros that actually execute on the device? Can it be manipulated? Yes. To give you comfort, Congressman, to give you comfort, that's why we're giving third-party monitors. As an expert, I think you can agree that very few companies have to do this. I've got the report.\n",

How do you determine what age they are then? We rely on age gating as our key age assurance. Age? Gating, which is when you ask the user what age they are. We have also developed some tools where we look at their public profile to go through the videos that they post to see whether... Boy, that's creepy. Tell me more about that. It's public. So if you post a video that you choose that video to go public, that's how you get people to see your video. We look at those to see if it matches up the age that you talked about.\n",

What a well-spoken individual. I'm sure the comments are just as respectful and cohesive as the comments on the video. Nope, they're weird. CCP! I only want to be spied on by Google. How can a minute clip be educative? It is poisoning. And that's just racism. Great idea to have a tech trial in front of people who are old enough to remember drawing the Mason Dixie line, Hey, while you guys were being racist in the comment section, I ordered you all copies of Beloved by Toni Morrison. And send your addresses to Mike DeSantis with the text attachment, Come get it, hot dick. So good luck explaining that one when Daddy DeSantis shows up for that sweet slow lovin'.
