==> SPEAKER_00: 
 back, gentleman from Texas. Chair recognizes for five minutes, Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you, Mr. Chu, for bringing Republicans and Democrats together. Appreciate that. I wanna get right to the critical point of concern. So TikTok is able to collect massive amounts of personal data, we all know that. That means it could, if it desired, to use this data to influence narratives and trends, create misinformation campaigns, encourage self-destructive behavior, purposefully allow drug cartels to communicate freely and organize human and drug trafficking. And to be fair, all social media companies could do that. But here's the difference. It is only TikTok that is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party. All these other social media companies are not. Mr. Chu, do you agree that TikTok is controlled by the CCP?
==> SPEAKER_01: 
 No.
==> SPEAKER_00: 
 Okay, I thought you'd say that. I disagree, as you thought I might say. Here's why I disagree. Your parent company is ByteDance, right?
==> SPEAKER_01: 
 That's correct.
==> SPEAKER_00: 
 It is correct. So many of the workers who work at ByteDance, they're Communist Party members, right?
==> SPEAKER_01: 
 I wouldn't know.
==> SPEAKER_00: 
 I wouldn't know. Well, I think, for example, the chief editor at ByteDance, Zhang Vuping, is the Communist Party secretary, correct?
==> SPEAKER_01: 
 He works under Chinese business, not on TikTok.
==> SPEAKER_00: 
 Right. He works for ByteDance. The parent company. He works on the Chinese business. Right. The parent company of TikTok.
==> SPEAKER_01: 
 He works on the Chinese business.
==> SPEAKER_01: 
 The Chinese business is called Douyin.
==> SPEAKER_00: 
 Yeah, but it's all associated with bite dance, right?
==> SPEAKER_01: 
 So by dance owns a number of businesses right there you are
==> SPEAKER_00: 
 Right, you all report to ByteDance. Everybody's part of ByteDance, okay? And do you know of any other employees that work for ByteDance that are part of the Chinese Communist Party?
==> SPEAKER_01: 
 Like I said, you know, they are, Bidense has owns Chinese businesses and they operate in China.
==> SPEAKER_00: 
 know how many, but you acknowledge many must be card-carrying members of the CCP, right?
==> SPEAKER_01: 
 In the Chinese business, yes.
==> SPEAKER_00: 
 I mean the CCP holds a what's called a golden share invite dance that allows the CCP to control one board seat invite dance That's public. It's not correct. It's not correct. It's been publicly reported. They admitted to it
==> SPEAKER_01: 
 That's not correct. It's not correct? It's been publicly reported. They admitted to it. You can, on our website, we have updated it so we can give people more transparent information on this. They have a share in a subsidiary that is only for the Chinese business. It has nothing to do with TikTok. And it's for the purposes of content licensing in China.
==> SPEAKER_00: 
 So there's not an internal CCP committee, which is a regular thing that happens in China. They have a CCP committee internally inside the company.
==> SPEAKER_01: 
 I run TikTok. I cannot represent this business.
==> SPEAKER_00: 
 Talking about ByteDance. No arrangement in ByteDance? Here's the main point of concern. China's 2017 national intelligence law states very clearly that, quote, any organization or citizen shall support, assist and cooperate with state intelligence work in accordance with the law and maintain the secrecy of all knowledge of state intelligence work. In other words, ByteDance and also your TikTok employees that live in China, they must cooperate with Chinese intelligence whenever they are called upon. And if they are called upon, they're bound to secrecy. That would include you. So Mr. Chu, if the CCP tells ByteDance to turn over all data that TikTok has collected inside the U.S., even within Project Texas, do they have to do so according to Chinese law?
==> SPEAKER_01: 
 So here's.
==> SPEAKER_01: 
 Congressman, first, I'm Singaporean.
==> SPEAKER_00: 
 That's fine, but there are employees of yours and by dances in China
==> SPEAKER_01: 
 China. We understand this concern. In my opening statement, we said we hear these concerns. We didn't try to avoid them or trivialize them. We built something where we take that data and put it out of reach. This is what we did. We put it out of reach. Out of reach, but they own you. No, we put it out of reach by storing them.
==> SPEAKER_00: 
 ByteDance owns TikTok. If ByteDance is told, and the CCP owns ByteDance because the CCP owns everybody in China. So by law, they can make them do whatever they want. And they say that by law, you can't tell anyone about it. So they can make you hand over that data. Is that correct?
==> SPEAKER_01: 
 And so my
==> SPEAKER_01: 
 That data is stored here, in American soil, by an American company, overseen by American
==> SPEAKER_00: 
 Well, you say that, we've thought that, but leaked audio from 80 internal TikTok meetings shows that US user data has been repeatedly accessed from China when you said it hasn't been. And here's the other thing, following back on my colleague's line of questioning, in your own privacy policy, it says that you may even share information within your so-called corporate group. Is ByteDance part of that corporate group?
==> SPEAKER_01: 
 If you're talking about the share of the entity with the share, like I shared with the previous Is ByteDance part of the corporate group? ByteDance as a holding company is part of the corporate group, yes.
==> SPEAKER_00: 
 Okay. So your own privacy policy says you have to share data with ByteDance. And if the CCP says, hey, ByteDance, you're going to do what we say, and you can't tell anyone about it, because by law, according to that 2017 national intelligence law, they have to do it. That's our concern. Maybe you haven't done it yet, but my point is that you might have to. And that's where our concerns come from. I mean, over 300 TikTok employees have worked for China's state‑run propaganda media. That's just from looking at their LinkedIn profiles. Okay. So my last point is this. I want to say this to all the teenagers out there and TikTok influencers who think we're just old and out of touch and don't know what we're talking about, trying to take away your favorite app. You may not care that your data is being accessed now, but it will be one day when you do care about it. And here's the real problem. With data comes power. They can choose what you see and how you see it. They can make you believe things that are not true. They can encourage you to engage in behavior that will destroy your life. Even if it is not happening yet, it could in the future. The long‑term goal of the Chinese Communist Party is the demise of the American power, and that starts with our youth. At any moment, they could demand that all of TikTok's data be used to design an AI algorithm with the sole purpose of promoting Chinese interests and destroying our society from within. You want to know why Democrats and Republicans have come together on this? That's why we are so concerned. Thank you, and I yield back.
==> SPEAKER_01: 
 Maybe you haven't done it yet.
