            "==> SPEAKER_00:: Only if the user turns on the Wi-Fi. I'm sorry, I may not understand the question.",
            "==> SPEAKER_01:: So if I have a TikTok app on my phone and my phone is on my home Wi-Fi network, does TikTok access that network?",
            "==> SPEAKER_00:: you will have to access the network to get connections to the internet, if that's the question.",
            "==> SPEAKER_01:: Is it possible, then, that it could access other devices on that home Wi-Fi network?",
            "==> SPEAKER_00:: Congressman, we do not do anything that is beyond any industry norms. I believe the answer to your question is no. It could be technical. Let me get back to you."
