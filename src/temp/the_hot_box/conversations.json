            "==> SPEAKER_10:: Sometimes, the world doesn't give you a break. You wake up, your tummy hurts, why god why? And it seems like this week was no different, as the news continued to be filled non-stop with things either coming to an end or being taken away from us. The biggest being when TikTok was tried in front of the US Congress, where there was incompetence, racism, and it really was one thing after another. So I thought we could sit down, talk about things, and maybe have a few laughs as we try to navigate the situation facing one of the biggest platforms for creators and the United States as a whole. Now without further ado, let's get right into it. Welcome back to the channel, new and returning, young and old, fans, haters, and everyone in between. If you're new here, why not subscribe? It's quick, it's easy, just takes a second, and you can always undo it, but it really does help out the channel a lot, so thank you. TikTok, or more specifically TikTok CEO, Shozy Choo, was placed before the United States Congress to discuss a potential ban of TikTok in the US. And we all know that old people in office and tech go together as well as bullets and that lake in RE4. The difference is that one situation reveals a gross, scaly monster clad in ignorance and hate and the other lets you meet DeLago. Ain't he cute? Unsurprisingly, this hearing from the most bipartisan committee in Congress was just one giant self-report on behalf of the Congress members. Most of the questions were meandering, meaningless, and a lot of them have this weird, read racist, idea that Mr. Choo represents the Chinese government and communism as a whole. Which is funny that they think that about the guy and the company that are both from Singapore. Choo was born on the 1st of January 1983 in Singapore. His father worked in construction while his mother was a bookkeeper. Choo is Singaporean, he is married to Vivian Cao. Congress seems to think that TikTok is this evil portal to threatening schools of thought that will destroy the country and our kids from the inside."

            "==> SPEAKER_10:: Which is just blatant ignorance to everything happening in their own backyard. Like, yeah, we made the country that starts wars everywhere, stages coups, has the world's largest prison population, and passes laws that actively put LGBTQIA plus people in danger. But the app with the funny meme videos, that's the real danger to our people. Let's get something clear, this is not to side with millionaires and CEOs globally. This is me saying, how brain dead is the US legislative system that I am here siding with a CEO? Mr. Chu's opening statement was incredibly strong. It highlighted many of the big concerns that were supposed to be discussed at the hearing."

            "==> SPEAKER_11:: Our app is a place where people can be creative and curious, and where close to 5 million American businesses, mostly small businesses, go to find new customers and to fuel their growth. We spend a lot of time adopting measures to protect teenagers. Many of those measures are firsts for the social media industry. The bottom line is this. American data stored on American soil by an American company, overseen by American personnel.",
            "==> SPEAKER_10:: This statement does well to focus on the positives TikTok provides to creators and, in particular, small businesses, as well as discusses what moves TikTok is doing to provide safety for its user base, regardless of age, and what it plans to do to ensure the safety of American data and user data in general. What a well-spoken individual. I'm sure the comments are just as respectful and cohesive as the comments on the video. Nope, they're weird. CCP! I only want to be spied on by Google. How can a minute clip be educative? It is poisoning. And that's just racism. Great idea to have a tech trial in front of people who are old enough to remember drawing the Mason Dixie line, Hey, while you guys were being racist in the comment section, I ordered you all copies of Beloved by Toni Morrison. And send your addresses to Mike DeSantis with the text attachment, Come get it, hot dick. So good luck explaining that one when Daddy DeSantis shows up for that sweet slow lovin'. Yeah, that's one of the books that Florida moved to ban in classrooms, so. I just made a bunch of people enemies of the state. Well, hey, let's see what these sentient blocks of tofu have to say, hmm? This one is from Representative Kat Kamik, a Republican representative for the state of Florida."

This one is from Representative Buddy Carter from Georgia, and this was posted on his official YouTube channel, so whatever is in here, he endorses proudly. Sort of how he endorsed a bill that would increase reimbursement rates for pharmacies when he owned three pharmacies. But apparently he couldn't increase the resolution on this video because it's stuck in 360p. Anyways, let's get right into it.",

            "==> SPEAKER_10:: The NyQuil Chicken Challenge? So many of these challenges began as actual jokes and memes, and I know internet post-humor is hard to grasp for some, but no child with more than five brain cells is taking any of these seriously. And if you are actually trying NyQuil chicken, you deserve everything that's coming to you.",
            "==> SPEAKER_06:: I want to ask you, as I understand it, there's a sister app in China, Duikin. I'm sorry if I'm butchering the pronunciation. Do they have these same things over there?",
            "==> SPEAKER_10:: Representative Carter asks whether these kinds of challenges are popular on Douyin, TikTok's Chinese sister app, because he seems to believe that they aren't and that indicates that TikTok is pushing harmful things exclusively in America. I have no doubt that there are similar phenomena across cultures because that's just how humor works. But also, in my opinion, if Douyin and China really don't have any of these challenges, that's more of a tell on us rather than them, because maybe they're just not stupid enough to do all this kind of stuff.",

            "==> SPEAKER_10:: It's clear that if anything, this case has highlighted the gross incompetency of people in power. I know, old news, but it especially warrants saying because we get to see it on full display, broadcasted right before our eyes. No term limits and plenty of other systemic flaws have stocked our legislative body with people that are straight up out of touch. These are the kinds of people that write off younger voices as stupid and inexperienced, when those are the kids that are going to be around much longer than them. These are the posterity and they're adapting to this world and learning to communicate their thoughts about it way faster than any of these walking bathroom tiles. Meanwhile, all they care about is their power."

And when the United States is proposing a very major move that has something to do with significant risk to national security, one of the first things that happens is that Congress receives a classified briefing. And I can tell you that Congress has not received a classified briefing around the allegations of national security risks.",

This was in reference to dangerous trends that supposedly started on TikTok, but after investigation turned out to have originated on Facebook.",

And I forgot about the like insider trading shit that happens in Congress, but I want you to think for a second. This isn't them just knowing information that'll change the value of stocks. This is them actually creating policy that will trade change the value of stocks and buying and selling stocks based on that."

And the Restrict Act, which is in the Senate right now, has some serious penalties for doing that. $250,000 on the civil side, plus up to a million dollars in criminal penalties and up to 20 years in jail. And they can take your phone or any products you were planning to sell on TikTok. It also exempts the Secretary of Commerce from the Paperwork Reduction Act for the purposes of implementing this act. So theoretically, they could also demand that you turn over sensitive personal information and then bury you in request for paperwork.",
