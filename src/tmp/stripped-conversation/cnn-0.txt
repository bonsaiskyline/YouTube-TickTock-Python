Oh tick tock CEO goes under oath and says his company is not a glaring risk to U.S. national security. Lawmakers though in both parties clearly not convinced. Piercing questions today up on Capitol Hill the hearing in the House Energy and Commerce Committee kicking off with a reminder that misleading Congress is a federal crime. Tick tocks chief very very careful in his answers. He says the app can keep data for millions of American users off limits from the Chinese government. But lawmakers counter. They say simply they don't believe it. They see tick tock as a weapon for the Chinese regime. Your platform should be banned. I expect today you'll say anything to avoid this outcome.
