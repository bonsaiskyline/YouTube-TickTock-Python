Yeah, well, there's also a broader conversation, too. I was talking to some senators yesterday. Of course, there's a national security component, but also there's the mental health component, especially for young people. And Senator Chris Murphy, for example, he told me that he has a teenage son, and he wants the conversation around TikTok to be much broader than just China and national security. And so he almost thinks that Congress is too singularly focused on China on this issue. So we'll see where this goes next. But that gets you into the broader conversation with other social media companies as well, where they talk a lot and they use them as a pi√±ata a lot, but they have been unable to reach a consensus about what to actually try to pass.
