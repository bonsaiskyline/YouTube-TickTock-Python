with me in studio to share their reporting and their insights. Leanne Caldwell of The Washington Post CNN's Melanie Zanona Francesca Chambers of USA Today and Sarah Fisher of Axios. The CEO is doing his best to say we will protect this data. We have this new project underway to get it out of Singapore get it out of Asia. We'll be all in America. They don't believe it. So the question is what will Congress do. The scorn is bipartisan. But there's a lot of scorn for Facebook and Instagram and Twitter and American social media companies and they can't agree on what to do. Will they agree here.||I think they're in a lot of agreement here. There seems to be bipartisan support for taking action on TikTok. The question's actually not what Congress will do, it's what will the courts do? So the White House and CFIUS, the Committee for Foreign Investment in the United States, may say that TikTok has to be banned if it's not sold to a US company. But like Donald Trump tried to do this in 2020, the courts will ultimately have to support that decision. That's where the next step of this comes to fruition. And then the last question, of course, is who even would buy TikTok? This is a very expensive company. You know, in 2020, when it had 50 million fewer users, it was valued at roughly 30 billion, according to some reports. Now imagine, who can even afford to buy something like that and get it passed through regulatory scrutiny? So there's a lot of questions, John, about how we get to this hearing to the next step.||And so the members of Congress are saying we will pass legislation allowing us to ban you from the United States unless you have a sale, a bite dance, a Chinese health company sell it publicly. The CEO keeps trying to say we hear you, we will fix it. Listen here, here's the idea being that look, we understand you think the Chinese government can access this data, we're going to create a firewall, it won't happen.
