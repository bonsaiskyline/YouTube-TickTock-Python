Yeah, there's a lot of politics here, too. This was a bipartisan grilling of the CEO of TikTok. So they are in agreement, members of Congress, Republicans and Democrats, on that. But this also comes with some political consequences also. Are members of Congress willing to ban TikTok, understanding that there are a lot of young users who use it, potential voters? There's been a higher percentage of young people who voted in the last election than in the last several decades. And this impacts Democrats more than it impacts Republicans. Republicans are a lot less worried about the political blowback than Democrats are. For example, the Senate Republican Campaign Committee, they actually have a policy that their candidates, that they do not use TikTok to campaign. Meanwhile, Democrats have been utilizing this app on the campaign trail. And so a ban might be too much for some Democrats. Yeah.
