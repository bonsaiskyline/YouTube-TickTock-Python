And I would point out, leadership in the House has actually not yet committed to bringing a ban forward. They said there's a number of different proposals. They're working their way through the committee process. I'd also point out, there are some lobbyists who are closely aligned to Kevin McCarthy, a former California Republican, who's lobbying on behalf of TikTok, a former McCarthy aide. So it is a question of what McCarthy's going to do, but this hearing was just a disaster for TikTok. You had lawmakers coming out in the middle of it, renewing their calls, or coming out for a ban on TikTok, if it shows you how well it went for TikTok. It's hard to imagine that there won't be some sort of congressional action.||Yeah, and it's interesting. You mentioned what will the administration do, what will the courts do. Congress has the ball at the moment. And the chairwoman, Cathy McMorris-Rogers, just scornful from the beginning, just full of distrust. And again, they want definitive answers. They want yes or no. Listen here as she presses for answers, and she says, I'm not getting them on the question of can you actually keep the Chinese? Can you say no to Xi Jinping, essentially?
