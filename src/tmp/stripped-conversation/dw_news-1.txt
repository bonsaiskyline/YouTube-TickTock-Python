More at ease on the app than defending it. CEO Sho Zichu faced a hostile grilling before a congressional committee. Lawmakers called the app a threat to ordinary Americans and to national security.

We do not trust TikTok will ever embrace American values, values for freedom, human rights, and innovation. TikTok has repeatedly chosen the path for more control, more surveillance, and more manipulation. Your platform should be banned. What lawmakers really wanted to know was how close the Chinese government is to TikTok's management and Shou repeatedly denied that he was under pressure from Beijing.
