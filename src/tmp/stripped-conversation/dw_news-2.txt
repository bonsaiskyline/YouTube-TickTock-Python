Congressman, since I've been CEO of this company, I've not had any discussions with Chinese government officials. The app is owned by the Chinese company ByteDance. Critics say that Beijing could force TikTok to hand over information on millions of Americans, something that TikTok denies. Congresswoman, I have seen no evidence that the Chinese government has access to that data. They have never asked us, we have not provided. I have asked that question.
