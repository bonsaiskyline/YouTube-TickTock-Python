I think that's exactly right. I think we saw him receive one of the frostiest receptions from US Congress that we have seen in years. And this was a committee that was extraordinarily well-prepared to ask the hard-hitting questions, both about TikTok's Chinese ownership, and that included very detailed questions about financial ties, Shou Chu's own compensation, and whether that comes from TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, the compensation of employees, his own relationship with ByteDance employees and members of the Chinese Communist Party. So really detailed questions on TikTok's Chinese ties, and also really detailed questions on the technology itself. You know, we heard lawmakers talk about bytecode and about neural network architectures and artificial intelligence, and that's pretty unprecedented for the US Congress, which five years ago, when they were grilling Mark Zuckerberg, had absolutely no clue what they were talking about. Bye.
