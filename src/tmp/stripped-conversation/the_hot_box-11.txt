Mr. Chiu, does TikTok access the home Wi-Fi network? So if I have a TikTok app on my phone and my phone is on my home Wi-Fi network, does TikTok access that network? Is it possible, then, that it could access other devices on that home Wi-Fi network? It's clear that if anything, this case has highlighted the gross incompetency of people in power. I know, old news, but it especially warrants saying because we get to see it on full display, broadcasted right before our eyes. No term limits and plenty of other systemic flaws have stocked our legislative body with people that are straight up out of touch. These are the kinds of people that write off younger voices as stupid and inexperienced, when those are the kids that are going to be around much longer than them. These are the posterity and they're adapting to this world and learning to communicate their thoughts about it way faster than any of these walking bathroom tiles. Meanwhile, all they care about is their power.
