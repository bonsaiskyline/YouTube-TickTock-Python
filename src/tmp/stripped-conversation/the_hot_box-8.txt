Yeah, I'm gonna have to move on too. Let's look at some of the other questions. This one is from Representative Buddy Carter from Georgia, and this was posted on his official YouTube channel, so whatever is in here, he endorses proudly. Sort of how he endorsed a bill that would increase reimbursement rates for pharmacies when he owned three pharmacies. But apparently he couldn't increase the resolution on this video because it's stuck in 360p. Anyways, let's get right into it.||We may not always agree on how to get there, but we care about our national security.||You apparently don't care about getting the name of the person you're speaking to, right?||Thank you Madam Chair. Mr. Crew, welcome to the most bipartisan committee in Congress.||Who the fuck is Mr. Crew? Well, maybe this guy can go a full minute without mentioning communism.||And you know, research has shown that TikTok is the most addictive platform out there. And the Chinese Communist Party knows this. Uh, nope.||50 seconds, so close.||because two-thirds of all the youth in our country are on your app.||Two-thirds? This guy seems more like a fan of three-fifths if you catch my drift.||If you look behind me, Mr. Cruz, you see some of the challenges that we've seen on TikTok. You know about them. You know about the milk crate. You know about the blackout challenge. You know about the NyQuil chicken challenge.||The NyQuil Chicken Challenge? So many of these challenges began as actual jokes and memes, and I know internet post-humor is hard to grasp for some, but no child with more than five brain cells is taking any of these seriously. And if you are actually trying NyQuil chicken, you deserve everything that's coming to you.||I want to ask you, as I understand it, there's a sister app in China, Duikin. I'm sorry if I'm butchering the pronunciation. Do they have these same things over there?||Representative Carter asks whether these kinds of challenges are popular on Douyin, TikTok's Chinese sister app, because he seems to believe that they aren't and that indicates that TikTok is pushing harmful things exclusively in America. I have no doubt that there are similar phenomena across cultures because that's just how humor works. But also, in my opinion, if Douyin and China really don't have any of these challenges, that's more of a tell on us rather than them, because maybe they're just not stupid enough to do all this kind of stuff.||Tell me, tell me why!
