So, Mr. Chu, if the CCP tells ByteDance to turn over all data that TikTok has collected inside the U.S., even within Project Texas, do they have to do so according to Chinese law?||Congressman, first, I'm Singaporean.||That's fine, but there are employees of yours and by dances in China||We understand this concern. In my opening statement, we said we hear these concerns. We didn't try to avoid them or you know, trivialize them. We built something where we take that data and put it out of reach. This is what we did. We put it out of reach. Out of reach, but they own you. No, we put it out of reach by storing them.||ByteDance owns TikTok. If ByteDance is told, and the CCP owns ByteDance, because the CCP owns everybody in China. So by law, they can make them do whatever they want, and they say that by law, you can't tell anyone about it. So they can make you hand over that data. Is that correct?||It's a violent.||Data is stored here in American soil by an American company overseen by American...||Well, you say that. We've thought that, but leaked audio from 80 internal TikTok meetings shows that US user data has been repeatedly accessed from China when you said it hasn't been.
