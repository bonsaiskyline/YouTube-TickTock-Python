Can you say with a hundred percent certainty that TikTok does not use the phone's camera to determine whether the content that elicits a pupil dilation should be amplified by the algorithm? Can you tell me that? We do not collect body, face or voice data to identify our users. We do not. You don't? No. The only face data that you get, that we collect, is when you use the filters to have sunglasses on your face, we need to know where your eyes are. Why do you need to know what the eyes are if you're not seeing if they're dilated?  And that data is stored on your local device and deleted after use if you use it for facial. Again, we do not collect body, face, or voice data to identify our users.
