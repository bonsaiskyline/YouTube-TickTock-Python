That's not my question. get all sorts of content out of that stuff. That's not my question. My question is, do you agree that the Chinese government has persecuted the Uyghur population?

It's a pretty easy question. Do you agree that the Chinese government has persecuted the Uyghur population? Congressman, I'm here to discard TikTok and what we do as a platform. And as a platform, we allow our users to freely express their views on this issue and any other issue that matters to them. All right. We're weird today. Well, you didn't answer the question.
