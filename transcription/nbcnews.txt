TikTok is getting on offense tonight here in Washington with a bunch of creators descending on the nation's capital, joining a few lawmakers to rally on the Hill just within the last maybe 30, 40 minutes or so. Let me play for you what one of these members of Congress defending TikTok had to say. In terms of TikTok's behavior and its risk to national security, it poses about the same threat that companies like Facebook and Instagram and YouTube and Twitter pose. So let's not marginalize and target TikTok. So that's Congressman Jamal Bowman, who's become the highest profile ally, if you will, yet of TikTok on Capitol Hill. And you can see a bunch of TikTokers, maybe some that are landing on your For You page, who are here in D.C., had a very high profile testimony tomorrow from the company's head. TikTok's promising to protect U.S. user data, promising to keep the app safe, especially for minors, for kids, to stay independent and to be transparent. I want to bring in now Julie Serkin. And Julie, you know, there's a lot at stake here, and TikTok knows that. They have ramped up their lobbying. There's some growing concern now among some Democrats that a ban could actually alienate young voters. One Harvard student used TikTok to rally support for Joe Biden in 2020 and is now telling NBC News if they went ahead with banning TikTok, it would feel like a slap in the face to a lot of young Americans. Yeah, exactly, Haley. And I was watching part of this press conference actually on TikTok because one of the influencers was live streaming it. And that's exactly the point she was making and all of the comments were making. She actually said, we put President Biden in the White House, we delivered him the votes. And that's a message that's got to resonate with some Democrats up here. You saw three progressives, two joining Bowman, who you heard from at the top there. He tried to kind of stick a fork in this argument that it's a national security risk by saying, look, what about Facebook? What about Twitter? What about all the misinformation we saw from them in the 2016 election? But I had a Senate intelligence source actually saying, pushing back on that, saying it's not a fair comparison. TikTok is owned in some way by the Chinese government. They're responsible to answer to the Chinese Communist Party, whereas Facebook at the end of the day is a US-based company and answers to the US government here. So sort of shedding some separation between the two platforms there. But this is just so fascinating here because in a lot of ways, these TikTok creators did a lot of the work for this TikTok CEO for him ahead of that testimony tomorrow by coming up here, by sharing their message. We heard from small business owners on TikTok. One woman actually said 95 percent of her business, of her orders come from TikTok and they just can't move to another platform. One of the creators that I was talking to said, we don't want to move to another platform. We don't like that house with those decorations over there, is how she put it. So this is just a fascinating debate here. But unfortunately, those three progressive lawmakers appear to be the only ones standing behind these creators ahead of that TikTok CEO testifying tomorrow, because everyone else up here is saying, listen, this is a bigger national security risk than anything. We know the Department of Justice opened an investigation into how they potentially target American citizens and even journalists. So this is something that is not just going to go away because TikTok influencers descended up here. I want you to take a listen and kind of watch on your screen some of the videos that these influencers were putting out today while they were up here. Watch. Some of them going around here in the first one, you know, they were touring the Capitol saying that we, you know, we never heard other influencers be up here. But you also heard from others who were trying to go door to door, meet with lawmakers, just trying to get someone to listen to them and say, hey, we're on this platform for a bigger reason than just to create dance videos. Give us a preview of tomorrow, Julie. What's the biggest thing you're going to be looking for in this very high profile hearing? Well, look, it's the first time that TikTok CEO is going to be testifying before Congress. And look, he's coming before a Republican led panel, the Energy Committee. And there is a lot of focus here on China as a whole between Democrats and Republicans. And that's certainly going to be a big focus of tomorrow's hearing. We know the CEO kind of went on this quote unquote charm offensive. He put out new policies that he's going to be putting in place to make sure that the platform he says is not compromised for national security risks. But that is 100 percent going to be the main talking point, not just for Republicans, but Democrats, too.
