Why, if you had nothing to hide, would you need to downplay the association with ByteDance in China? Congressman, I have not seen this memo. You can't answer that question. And you expect us to believe that you are capable of maintaining the data security, privacy and security of 150 million Americans? I think that is a blatant display of how vulnerable people who use TikTok are. You damn well know that you cannot protect the data and security of this committee or the 150 million users of your app, because it is an extension of the CCP. And with that, I yield back.
